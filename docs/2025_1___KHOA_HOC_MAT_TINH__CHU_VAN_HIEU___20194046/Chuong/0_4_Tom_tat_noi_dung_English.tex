In the context of an increasingly competitive labor market and the strong impact of digital transformation, traditional recruitment practices have revealed several limitations, particularly in identifying and selecting candidates who meet predefined requirements. At present, many recruitment websites mainly operate based on a job-posting and manual search model, in which the connection between employers and candidates largely relies on both parties proactively searching for each other, without effectively leveraging data to support screening and recommendation processes.

From this situation, this thesis undertakes the project entitled \textbf{Development of an Intelligent Recruitment Website}, which is based on the integration of employers’ requirements, candidates’ preferences, and candidates’ actual behaviors during the job search process. On that basis, the system provides personalized recommendations that are suitable for both candidates and employers. This approach enables both parties to make more informed decisions, while also contributing to a reduction in resume screening time and limiting prolonged yet inefficient interview processes.

The website serves as a platform connecting employers and candidates through features such as job recommendations for candidates, candidate recommendations for employers, proactive notification mechanisms, and other recruitment support functionalities. The obtained results fully meet the predefined functional requirements, allowing effective management of candidate profiles, user needs, and recommendation-related data.
